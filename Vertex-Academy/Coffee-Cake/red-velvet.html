	<p>A cupcake (also know as a fairy cake) is a small cake designed to be eaten by one person, baked in a thin paper
	wrapper, and decorated with frosting on top.</p>
	<p>One of the mainstays at Coffee & cake is our famous Red Velvet Cupcake. A well-guarded recipe combined with the
	natural ingredients make this little red rascal unapologetically delicious. Topped with decorative vanilla frosting,
	the Red Velvet Cupcake is a favorite among kids as well.</p>
